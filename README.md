# Compact-Heat-Exchanger-Optimization
This MATLAB script optimizes the design of a compact heat exchanger for circular, sinusoidal, and rectangular duct geometries using a genetic algorithm.

The theory used for the one-sided size and shape equations came from Compact Heat Exchangers: Selection, Design, and Operation by JE Hesselgreaves.
